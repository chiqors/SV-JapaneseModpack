=== SEASONAL ANIME PORTRAITS II ===


Thank you for trying out this mod.

This mod works by replacing Seasonal Villager Outfits' portraits from vanilla artstyle to OhoDavi's anime artstyle. We only provide the portraits' replacement and depend on SVO's coding and organizing. Hence, SAP is un/compatible with whichever mod SVO is too.

As half of our permission to use SVO's assets are revoked, SAP II is currently on semi-hiatus. We are developing SAP III to make our own code and designs. OhoDavi himself is now on the team!


==============================
==============================
HOW TO INSTALL :

1. Install Seasonal Villager Outfits (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2449) and its dependencies;
2. SMAPI (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400),
3. and Content Patcher (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915).
4. Extract the Seasonal Anime Portraits' file. You'll find two folders nested inside SAP folder: "[CP] Seasonal Villager Outfits" and "Seasonal Anime Portraits".
5. Place both folders into the mod folder.

The first folder will override portraits from SVO's folder and the latter has our manifest file to notify you for updates.

==============================
HOW TO INSTALL OPTIONAL FILES :

1. Make sure to install the main files correctly.
2. Download and extract the optional files you desire.
3. Place [CP] folder from within the alternative folder into the mod folder.

The alternative portraits will overwrite the main NPC's portraits.

==============================
HOW TO UNINSTALL :

1. Remove "[CP] Seasonal Villager Outfits" and "Seasonal Anime Portraits"' folders.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS :

Q: Why does X character's anime version doesn't appear?
A: This mod was in hiatus, and we plan on moving to SAP III with colaboration of OhoDavi himself. The remaining character won't be added as we also have to remake SVO's outfits.

Q: X character only has some portraits converted to anime.
A: We are up do date with SVO 2.2.8 only and half of our permission to use their assets is revoked. We deeply apologize for that.

Q: Why can't I see Sandy and Wizard's anime portraits?
A: Check out config.json file in SVO's folder. EnableSandy and EnableWizard are set as false by default. Set them as true and they should appear. If you can't find the file, try loading the game once and file will be generated.

Q: Why is there only Shaved facial hair variant of Harvey?
A: Harvey is currently buggy, so the Mustache variant is moved to an optional download so by default you wouldn't catch the bug. In the optinal downloads, there is Harvey's Mustache variant (including All Mustache Harvey) in case you prefer them.

Q: The portraits are there but why do they still not appear?
A: If you find them in their vanilla (not seasonal) version, you may want to report to SVO's mod page since that is possibly due to a bug in their code.

Q: Why aren't you updating??
A: We are currently developing SAP III from the code (with Paradigmnomad's help), to the designs including the spritesheets. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Q: Will there be an SVE version in the future?
A: OhoDavi is planning on making the portraits, so it's highly probable!


If your distress is left unanswered, you can try asking on our nexus mod page or discord server!
